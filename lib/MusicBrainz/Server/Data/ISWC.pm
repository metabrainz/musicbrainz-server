=method find_by_work

    find_by_work(@work_ids : Array[Integer])

Find L<MusicBrainz::Server::Entity::ISWC> objects that are linked to specific
works. The works are searched as a disjunction, so you will get all ISWCS linked
to any of the inputs.

Returns an array of ISWC objects.

=method load_for_works

    load_for_works(@works : Array[Work])

Load ISWCs for an array of works, and nest the ISWC objects inside each
respective work.

        }
    }
}

=method find_by_iswc

    find_by_iswc($iswc : Text)

Find ISWCs that have a specific ISWC. This can return a list of ISWCs that are
linked to different works.

=cut

sub find_by_iswc
{
    my ($self, $iswc) = @_;

    return $self->_find('iswc', $iswc);

=method delete

    delete(@iswc_ids : Array[Int])

Delete a list of ISWCs from the database, by ISWC row ID.

=cut

sub delete

    my ($self, @iswc_ids) = @_;
    $self->sql->do('DELETE FROM iswc
                    WHERE id IN ('.placeholders(@iswc_ids).')', @iswc_ids);
}

=method merge_works

    merge_works($new_work_id : Integer, @old_work_ids : Array[Integer])

Merge the ISWCs of an array of works into a single work.

=cut

sub merge_works

    my ($self, $new_id, @old_ids) = @_;
    my @ids = ($new_id, @old_ids);

=method delete_works

    delete_works(@work_ids : Array[Int])

Delete all ISWCs for a list of given works. The list of works is disjunctive, so
all ISWCs for each work will be deleted (rather than ISWCs that are only used by
all works).

=cut

sub delete_works

=method insert

    insert(@iswcs : Array[IswcHash])

Insert an array of ISWCs. No checks are done to ensure that the ISWC does not
already exist for a given work, so this could throw an exception.

An IswcHash has key:

    iswc : Text
    work_id : Int

}

=method filter_additions

    fiter_additions(@iswcs : Array[IswcEditHash])

Filter a list of insertions down to unique and new additions, ready for
inserting via an AddISWCs edit. C<IswcEditHash> is the data passed in to the
edit.

=cut
