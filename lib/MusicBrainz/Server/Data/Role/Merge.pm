# XXX HACK
# This is a bit ugly as Data::Entity already provides sub merge { }
# and roles will not overwrite methods that already exist (it assumes
# the method has already been provided). Here we ensure sub merge { }
# exists in some form, and then immeidately replace all the behaviour
# with an 'around' modifier.
#
# This will be solved by MBS-2618
