    # 2. The last medium should match the amount of mediums
    # 3. The sum of all mediums should match a standard arithmetic progression.
    #    This is used to ensure that the list of medium positions is linear,
    #    has no gaps, and no duplicates.
    #    E.g. If the medium had mediums: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5 then
    #    the following will *not* hold:
    #    1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
