Indicates whether the URL contains bytes that can't be interpreted as UTF-8.

Returns a fully decoded form of the URL for display, except when the local
part isn't in UTF-8.

NB. This form cannot (reliably) be converted back into a working URL.

Return a human readable display of this URL. This is usually the URL with
most character entities decoded, except when the URL uses a legacy encoding.
In that case, the URL is displayed as it is in the database, complete with
character entities.
