=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents multiple OAuth tokens. Which type is it depends on
the set of defined attributes.

First of all, it can be an authorization code. In this case only the
authorization_code attribute is set. The expire_time attribute is set
to the time when this code expires.

After the authorization code has been exchanged for an access token,
the authorization_code attribute will be cleared and attributes
access_token and refresh_token set. Attribute expire_time now refers
to the expiration time of the access token. The access token can be
of two types:

* Bearer - In this case the secret attribute is undefined and the token
  can be used only over secure connections. The access token should be
  treated as a password.

* MAC - The secret attribute is defined as well, and the access token
  can be transmitted plain text, because all requests have to be signed
  with the shared secret.
