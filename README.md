MusicBrainz Server
==================

MusicBrainz Server is the web frontend to the MusicBrainz Database
and is accessible at http://musicbrainz.org.

MusicBrainz is a user-maintained open community that collects music metadata
and makes it available to the public in the form of a relational database.
For more information, [visit our website](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About).

To get help, please join #metabrainz on irc.libera.chat

Breaking changes to the database schema or our API / web service will be announced on
[our blog](https://blog.metabrainz.org/category/musicbrainz+breaking-changes/),
so consider following that.
