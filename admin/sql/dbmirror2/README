ReplicationSetup.sql and MasterSetup.sql are copied from
https://github.com/metabrainz/dbmirror2, commit eda9923. (These are the only
two files we need, and submodules are "difficult.")

This is not a fork; please do not make any changes to the files here without
first submitting them upstream to dbmirror2. They should exactly mirror the
commit mentioned in the first paragraph.
