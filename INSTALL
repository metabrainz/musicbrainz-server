Installing mb_server
--------------------

mb_server is the web front end to the MusicBrainz data (as displayed at
http://musicbrainz.org/), and this document explains how you can get everything
up and running.

We've tried to make installation as painless as possible, but first - a few
prerequisites:

Prequisites
-----------

1)	Perl 5.8.0

	Perl 5.8.0 (minimum) is required. You can use Perl 5.10.0, but be aware that it
	has some quirks in handling subroutine attributes, which can make debugging
	difficult in a few cases.
	
	You can check your installed version of Perl with:
	
	    perl -v
	
2)  Postgres 8.3

    This is to set up the MusicBrainz database. If you compile Postgres from source, make sure to 
    also compile the cube extension found in contrib/cube. The database import script will take 
    care of installing that extension into the database when it creates the database for you.

Getting going
-------------

1) Make a checkout of the code.

    svn co http://svn.musicbrainz.org/mb_server/trunk mb_server
	
2) Configure the server

	cd mb_server
	cp lib/DBDefs.pm.default lib/DBDefs.pm
	
    Edit the newly copied DBDefs.pm as need be. For the most part, it should be
    fine to use as is. Refer to INSTALL for more indepth info about this, and 
    how it ties in with running a copy of the MusicBrainz database.
    
3) Install prerequisite Perl modules

    The Module::Install module reads a file called Makefile.PL to create a standard
    Makefile. This Makefile can then be used to install dependant Perl modules. First,
    make sure you have inc-Module-Install on your system:

        perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Install'
            
    Now, build the Makefile, and install dependancies (if necessary)
    
        perl ./Makefile.PL
        sudo make installdeps

        This will generate a standard Makefile, which you can use to install dependancies:

4) Create the databases

    Before you start, you need to install a C extension on your database server. You will
    need libunac (https://gna.org/projects/unac/) and PostgreSQL development headers. Then
    run these commands:

        cd postgresql-unaccent
        make
        sudo make install

	You have 2 options when it comes to databases. You can either opt for a clean database,
	with just the schema (useful for developers with little free diskspace), or you can use
	a copy of the MusicBrainz data.
	
	a) Using Clean Databases
	
		To use clean databases, all you need to do is run:
		
			./admin/InitDb.pl --createdb --clean
		
	b) Using Database Dumps pre NGS

                IMPORTANT NOTE: Until the actual release of the NGS code-base you will need to import
                data using the 20090524 code-base!! Follow these instructions for a "Database only" install:

                        http://bugs.musicbrainz.org/browser/mb_server/branches/RELEASE_20090524-BRANCH/INSTALL

                To ensure that the data imports cleanly, make sure to use a data dump from 2009-06-19 or later!

                Once you have the database properly loaded, return to the NGS codebase and run:

                        ./upgrade.sh

                This will convert the data to the NGS format. Please note that this process will take some
                time -- please be patient!
	
	c) Using Database Dumps post NGS release (Fall 2009)

		MusicBrainz frequently do full dumps of the database, which you can import to your own
		local database. This is the best option for long term developers. The database dumps are
		stored at
		
			ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport
		
		To get going, you need at least the mbdump.tar.bz2 and mbdump-derived.tar.bz2 archives,
		but you can grab whichever dumps suit your needs. Assuming the dumps have been downloaded
		to `/tmp/dumps/' you can then import with:
		
			./admin/InitDb.pl --createdb --import /tmp/dumps/mbdump*.tar.bz2 --echo
			
		--echo just gives us a bit more feedback, in case this goes wrong - you can leave it off.
		Remember to change the paths to your mbdump*.tar.bz2 files, if they are not in /tmp/dumps/.

5) Load WikiDocs transclusion file (optional)

	If you would like to have the /doc pages load properly on a RT_STANDALONE installation, follow 
	these steps:

	       cd <mb_server>/root/static/wikidocs
	       curl http://musicbrainz.org/generated/wikitrans-index > index.txt

	After this, the documentation index should be loadable.

6) Start the development server

	You should now have everything ready to run the development server! The development server is
	a lightweight HTTP server, that gives good debug output, and is much more convenient than having
	to set up a full blown stack. Just run:

		./script/musicbrainz_server.pl -r
	
	Visiting http://your.machines.ip.address:3000 should now present you with the mb_server frontend.

If, however, this *doesn't* happen - please contact aCiD2 on IRC, or file a bug at
http://bugs.musicbrainz.org.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
