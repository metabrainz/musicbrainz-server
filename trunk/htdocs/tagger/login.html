				In order to submit tagged information you will need to have an account
				on the MusicBrainz server. The data you submit to the server will
				be labelled with your login name so that other people can see who
				contributed these IDs.

				<p>
				The system is designed to give credit to the people who contribute
				to MusicBrainz as well as ensuring that people cannot spam or maliciously
				alter the data in the database.

				<p>
				Creating a MusicBrainz account is simple. Use the link below to create
				an account now. Once you've created an account, please
				open the <i>Options Dialog</i> and enter your username and password.
				Then you should be ready to submit your IDs to MusicBrainz.
