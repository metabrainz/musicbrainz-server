  summary: Search artists based on search criteria
  description: |
    An artist search request allows you to search for artists based on
    some conditions. Searches always return the same specific set of data
    and are mostly meant to help you find the MBID for the artist you want,
    so you can do any more specific queries using it.
  operationId: ArtistSearch
  parameters:
    - name: query
      in: query
      description: |
        A Lucene search query; indicates what you are actually searching for.
        It supports the full [Lucene search syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_7_2/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description).

        For details on each of the main fields you can search, see the table
        below. For a behind-the-scenes list of all fields in the API, see
        [our Solr schema](https://github.com/metabrainz/mbsssss/blob/production/artist/conf/schema.xml).
        
        | Field | Description |
        | ----- | ----------- |
        | alias | (Part of) any alias attached to the artist (diacritics are ignored) |
        | area | (Part of) the name of the artist's main associated area |
        | arid | The artist's MBID |
        | artist | (Part of) the artist's name (diacritics are ignored) |
        | artistaccent | (Part of) the artist's name (with the specified diacritics) |
        | begin | The artist's begin date in ISO 8601 format (e.g. "1980-01-22") |
        | beginarea | (Part of) the name of the artist's begin area |
        | comment | (Part of) the artist's disambiguation comment |
        | country | The 2-letter code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) for the artist's main associated country |
        | end | The artist's end date in ISO 8601 format (e.g. "1980-01-22") |
        | endarea | (Part of) the name of the artist's end area |
        | ended | A boolean flag (true/false) indicating whether or not the artist has ended (a band is dissolved, or a person is deceased) |
        | gender | The artist's gender (“male”, “female”, “non-binary” or “not applicable”) |
        | ipi | An IPI code associated with the artist |
        | isni | An ISNI code associated with the artist |
        | primary_alias | (Part of) any primary alias attached to the artist (diacritics are ignored) |
        | sortname | (Part of) the artist's sort name |
        | tag | (Part of) a tag attached to the artist |
        | type | The artist's type (“person”, “group”, etc.) |

        You can combine multiple fields with ' AND ' (space, AND, space).

        To search specifically for unset fields, use `-search_field:*`.
        For example, “type:person AND -gender:*” will return artists set
        as type Person but without a gender set.

        If you don't specify a field and just enter bare terms (“Nirvana”),
        they will be searched for in the alias, artist and sortname fields.
        Keep in mind that when searching with bare terms you will need to
        [escape any Lucene special characters](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_7_2/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Escaping_Special_Characters).

        Queries are represented as a simple free-text string due to current
        OpenAPI limitations; you will need to construct your query string
        by hand, such as “area:France AND type:group”.
