===============================================

Testing
-------

We use standard Perl tools for unit testing. Tests are located in the t/
directory. The preferred way to run them is to use the `prove` program from
Test::Harness. For example, to run all tests use:

 $ prove -l t/

Or if you want to run only specific tests:

 $ prove -l t/entity_artist.t
 $ prove -l t/entity*.t

Cache

Keys:

 * at:INT -- artist type by ID
 * ac:INT -- artist credit by ID
 * artist:INT -- artist by ID
 * artist:UUID -- artist ID by MBID (you need to do another lookup by ID)
 * g:INT -- gender by ID
 * c:INT -- country by ID
 * label:INT -- label by ID
 * label:UUID -- label by MBID (you need to do another lookup by ID)
 * lng:INT -- language by ID
 * lt:INT -- label type by ID
 * mf:INT -- medium format by ID
 * rgt:INT -- release group type by ID
 * rs:INT -- release status by ID

Debug information
-----------------

If you have CATALYST_DEBUG set to true, in DBDefs, the built in server
(script/musicbrainz_server.pl) will run in a development environment. This will
cause debug information to be generated on every page, and all HTML pages will
have debug panels available to view this information. To get to these panels,
simply click the "?" icon in the top right of each page.
