"Beginner editors are the ones most likely to need a friendly eye on their "

"that go against the MusicBrainz guidelines, or seem otherwise wrong, and "
"leave notes guiding the editor so that they can do better in the future. "

"well-entered data, and above all remember to be nice. Chances are if these "
"users are making a terrible mess, they’re not doing it on purpose but out of "
"confusion: MusicBrainz can be daunting for newcomers! If at all possible, "
"fix the errors (and let the editor know that you’ve done that and that they "
"can check the edits you made to see how it should look like) rather than "
"voting “No” on edits, since “No” votes can be quite discouraging, especially "
"as a new editor. If something is just so bad that there’s no fixing it and "
"it is making the existing data worse, do vote against the edit, but make "
"sure to explain nicely why that is needed, rather than just silently “No”-"
"voting. For a longer overview of the attitude we’re hoping for, see "
