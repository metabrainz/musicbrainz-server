            check which MusicBrainz release fits the release in Amazon (look
            at the format, tracklist, etc). If the release has a barcode,
            you can also search Amazon for it and see which ASIN matches.
            You might also find some ASINs linked to several discs
            of a multi-disc release: just merge those (see
